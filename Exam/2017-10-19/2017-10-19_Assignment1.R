## Learn a Bayesian network (BN) from the Asia dataset that is included in the bnlearn
## package. To load the data, run data("asia"). Learn both the structure and the
## parameters. Use any learning algorithm and settings that you consider appropriate.
## Identify a d-separation in the BN learned and show that it indeed corresponds to an
## independence in the probability distribution represented by the BN. To do so, you may
## want to use exact or approximate inference with the help of the bnlearn and gRain
## packages. (2.5 p)
