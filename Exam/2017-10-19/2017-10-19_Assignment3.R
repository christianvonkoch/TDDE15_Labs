## Let f~GP(0,k(x,x')) a priori and let sigmaf^2 = 1. Simulate and plot 5 realizations from the prior distribution of f
## over the grid xGrid=seq(-1,1,by=0.1) for the length scales l=0-2 and l=1 (in two separate figures). Compute:
## i) Corr(f(0), f(0.1))
## ii) Corr(f(0),f(0.5))
## for the two length scales. Discuss the results and connect your discussion to the concept of smoothness of f.
